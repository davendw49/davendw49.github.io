## About Me

Currently, I am a Research Fellow at the Bayes Centre, the University of Edinburgh, working in collaboration with [Prof. Luo Mai](https://luomai.github.io/), [Prof. Jeff Pan](https://knowledge-representation.org/j.z.pan/), and [Prof. Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/). I served as the visiting research fellow at Li Auto. Prior to joining the University of Edinburgh, I was a Research Assistant at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), where I worked with Prof. *Lei Chen* and Prof. *Lionel M. Ni*. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Acemap IIOT Lab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I had the privilege of being supervised by Prof. *Weinan Zhang*, Prof. *Luoyi Fu*, and Prof. *Xinbing Wang*. During my early research career, I interned with the Data Team at TikTok and as an Applied Scientist at Amazon Shanghai AI Lab. In 2021, I was also selected for the *Wenjun Wu Honored Ph.D. Class*.

## Research Interests

- **NLP and System:** Hardware-co-Designed LLM, AI Agent System 
- **AI for Science and Social Goods:** GeoAI, Scientific Data Mining

## Highlight

We release the **Hardware Co-Design Scaling Law** for edge deployment, introducing a principled framework for selecting the most suitable LLM for specific hardware and application constraints. By explicitly linking model architecture, training loss, and inference latency through roofline modelling, this work identifies the Pareto frontier between model accuracy and inference latency.
