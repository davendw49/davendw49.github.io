## About Me

Currently, I am a Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, working in collaboration with [Prof. Luo Mai](https://luomai.github.io/) (PI) and [Prof. Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/). Prior to joining the University of Edinburgh, I was a Research Assistant at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), where I worked with *Prof. Lei Chen* and *Prof. Lionel M. Ni*. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Acemap IIOT Lab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I had the privilege of being supervised by Prof. *Weinan Zhang*, *Prof. Luoyi Fu*, and *Prof. Xinbing Wang*. During my early research career, I interned with the Data Team at TikTok and as an Applied Scientist at Amazon Shanghai AI Lab. In 2021, I was also selected for the [Wenjun Wu Honored Ph.D. Class](https://ai.sjtu.edu.cn/cultivate/postgraduate/managements).

## Research Interests

- **Natural Language Processing :** Long-context LLM, Hardware-co-Designed LLM
- **AI for Science and Social Goods:** GeoAI, Scientific Data Mining

## Highlight

We release the **The PLM** (Peripheral Language Model) series, a novel model architecture to peripheral computing by delivering powerful language capabilities within the constraints of resource-limited devices. In the future, the PLM Team will keep doing research on PLM with modeling and system co-design.
