## About Me

<!-- Currently, I am a postdoctoral associates at the University of Edinburgh, collobrated with Prof. Luo Mai, and Prof. Jun Wang.
Before joining the University of Edinburgh, I was a visiting student at the institute of parallel and distributed systems (IPADS), working with Prof. Zeyu Mi, and a research assistant at Hong Kong University of Technology (Guangzhou), working with Prof. Lei Chen, and Prof. Jun Wang.-->
I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science in Acemap, IIOT Lab, at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I have the honor of being supervised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/), [Prof. Luoyi Fu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fu-ly/index.html) and [Prof. Xinbing Wang](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/). During my early research career, I've been interning at TikTok in the Data team, and I also interned as applied scientist at Amazon Shanghai AI Lab. Moreover, I was selected into [Wenjun Wu Honored Ph.D. Class](https://ai.sjtu.edu.cn/cultivate/postgraduate/managements) in 2021.

During my doctoral period, one of the key feedbacks I receive from industry projects and interdisciplinary collaborators is that the LLM should be highly reliable and efficient deployment in actual application. So I adjust my focus to LLM system in the coming career. **Recently, I am devoted to the research of on-device large language model**, doing some projects about the training, deployment, and the application of **LLM for edge-side or IoT**.

## Research Interests

- **Natural Language Processing :** Long-context LLM, On-device LLM
- **Machine Learning:** ML-System co-Design, Distributed ML
- **AI for Science and Social Goods:** GeoAI, AI for Design

## Highlight

We release the **The PLM** (Peripheral Language Model) series, a novel model architecture to peripheral computing by delivering powerful language capabilities within the constraints of resource-limited devices. In the future, the PLM Team will keep doing research on PLM with modeling and system co-design.
