## About Me

Currently, I'm pursuing my doctoral degree in Computer Science in Acemap, IIOT Lab, at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I have the honor of being supervised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/), [Prof. Luoyi Fu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fu-ly/index.html) and [Prof. Xinbing Wang](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/). I was also selected into [Wenjun Wu Honored Ph.D. Class](https://ai.sjtu.edu.cn/cultivate/postgraduate/managements) in 2021.

Recently, I am devoted to the research of specialized domain large language models (collaborating with [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/) and [Prof. Zhouhan Lin](https://hantek.github.io/)) and utilizing AI techniques especially LLM as AI Agents to solve data science related real-life issues (collaborating with [Prof. Ying Wen](https://yingwen.io/)).

## Research Interests

- **Natural Language Processing :** Long-context LLM, Hardware-awared Language Modeling
- **Machine Learning:** Distributed ML, ML System
- **AI for Science and Social Goods:** GeoAI, AI for Design
